# YTD - YouTube Playlist Downloader

## How to Use
 - Install Libraries from requirements.txt
 - Copy and Paste links into Data.json
 - Run Downloader_Routine 
 - Wait for songs to finish downloading (May take a while)
 - Finished

## Notes 
 - Downloaded songs are in the Music folder, grouped by playlist name
 - Downloading speed isn't the fastest (I will get around to fixing this)
